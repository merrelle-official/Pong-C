# Pong-C
Ping pong console application on C

Controls:

    Left racket:
        "A" - up
        "Z" - down
        
    Right racket:
        "K" - up
        "M" - down
        
    Other:
        "Enter" - next step
        "Q" - quit the game

The game continues until one of the players scores 21 points. 
After the goal, the ball continues its movement along the already planned trajectory.
The whole game is presented in step-by-step mode using only the standard library "stdio.h"
The project does not use additional functions, all the code is described in main().
There are no duplicate elements.
To run the program, go to the src folder and run "pong.exe".

P.S.
This is my first educational project in C. 
There are many ways to improve it (reflection from the rackets in different directions, changing the speed of the ball during the game, etc.)
